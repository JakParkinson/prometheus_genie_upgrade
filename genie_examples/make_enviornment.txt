I used absolite paths on the .sh slurm scripts that anyone on the cluster should be able to execute by runnign "sbatch ___.sh". 
This should work except probably for the line 'conda activate myenv' which has no easy way to use aboslute paths.

If you have the necessary python packages with versions installed in a conda or pyenv you could replace that line with the line to activate your own enviornment.

Alternatively,  one could make a copy of my own environment using the yml file in this folder and the command:

conda env create -f /groups/icecube/shared_location/environment.yml -n your_env_name

If you use the enviornment name 'myenv' I think the slurm should work without changing anything, but not sure as I can't really test this.


For the ipynb, it's a bit trickier. It may work with just the new conda enviornment, but if it doesn't then try:

Step1:
# Create a wrapper script
cat > ~/jupyter_with_intel.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
module load astro
module load hdf5/intel/1.10.4
module load intel/20.0.4
source /software/astro/anaconda/anaconda3-2020.11/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate myenv
source /groups/icecube/jackp/setup_prometheus_and_genie.sh
exec "$@"
EOF

chmod +x ~/jupyter_with_intel.sh

Step2:
# Create the kernel directory
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/myenv_with_intel

# Create the kernel.json file
cat > ~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels/myenv_with_intel/kernel.json << EOF
{
 "argv": [
  "~/jupyter_with_intel.sh",
  "python",
  "-m",
  "ipykernel_launcher",
  "-f",
  "{connection_file}"
 ],
 "display_name": "Python (myenv with Intel)",
 "language": "python"
}
EOF

Step3:
In vscode command pallette(ctrl + shift + P) search for Preferences: Open Remote Settings (Json) and add:

{
    "jupyter.kernelspec.path": "~/.local/share/jupyter/kernels"
}

Step4:
Restart and select "Python (myenv with Intel)" kernel

Step 5:
I had to fix my python paths manually in a code cell, there are two lines that a user (that is not jackp) would need to change:

sys.path.insert(0, '/groups/icecube/jackp/prometheus_genie_cleaned/harvard-prometheus')
sys.path.insert(0, '/groups/icecube/jackp/prometheus_genie_cleaned/harvard-prometheus/genie_examples')

instead of /jackp/.... replace with your username and your path to prometheus and then the genie_examples folder
